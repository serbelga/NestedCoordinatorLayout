# NestedCoordinatorLayout

Sample project to test how to use a CoordinatorLayout within another. There are two AppBarLayout, the inner AppBarLayout and the outer AppBarLayout, 
both with different scroll flags.

⚠️ This sample works OK with `com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0`. Stopped working from version 1.2.0.
